# Engineering Challenge

This repository contains the solution and documentation for the engineering challenge.

It is composed of 3 folders, each representing a different part of the challenge:

- [Shopify Store](./shopify/README.md): Contains the detailed documentation for an online store built using Shopify. A link to the store should be provided over email.
- [Backend Challenge](./backend/NOTES.md): Contains the source code and documentation for the backend challenge (NOTES.md).
- [Frontend Challenge](./frontend/README.md): Contains the source code and documentation for the frontend challenge (README.md).

> Note: Everything was centralized in this repository for simplicity. This structure is not representative of a real-world project.

## Personal Notes

Although not complex in feature, this challenge was quite long. Some shortcuts were taken here and there to make good time (detailed in each section)
If there are any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you ! ðŸš€
