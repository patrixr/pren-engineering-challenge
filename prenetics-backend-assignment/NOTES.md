# Backend Engineering Challenge Approach

## 1. Initial decision making

// base decisions on mock data in search file
// use swagger as a reference for API design
// update of express validator
// write tests according to existing mock
// create factories for mock data
// re-create tests using factories and real implementation

## 2. Base project setup

In its initial state, the project had a few issues that I first needed to address:

- It did not boot properly due to a problematic Postgres package version
- Integration testing was not set up in any form
